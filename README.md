### Hi there I am Henry 👋

I am Henry Biko, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer. I am graduating from Minerva University in December 2021 with a degree in Computational Science.

I enjoy bridging the gap between analytics and decision-making — combining my technical knowledge and passion for solving problems and identifying patterns within data. For the past four years, I have traveled the world with my school working on different projects such as time series predicting carbon emission by 2030, cloth image classification with TensorFlow, simulation of physical systems, sentimental analysis with Natural Language processing. 

I also relish the challenge of engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge set, as I continue to learn new languages and development techniques
