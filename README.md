### Hi there I am [Henry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrybiko/) ðŸ‘‹
![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/n6mEMqAuYOQ8l8qcEE/giphy.gif)<br><br>
I am  a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a degree in Computational Science from Minerva University: Concentrations(Artificial Intelligence, Applied Problem Solving & Data Science and Statistics)

I enjoy bridging the gap between analytics and decision-making â€” combining my technical knowledge and passion for solving problems and identifying patterns within data. For the past four years, I have traveled the world with my school working on different projects such as time series predicting carbon emission by 2030, cloth image classification with TensorFlow, simulation of physical systems, sentiment-analysis with Natural Language processing. 

I also relish the challenge of engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge set, as I continue to learn new languages and development techniques
